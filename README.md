# ðŸ§® Bistro-matic - Infinite Calculator

> See the subject [here](https://github.com/lucasmrdt/bistro-matic/blob/master/subject.pdf)

## Project description
> The goal of this project is to write a program that will display the result of an evaluated mathematical expression. The expression will be composed of infinite integers that can be expressed in any base.
The program must handle the following operators: +-*/%, parentheses, operation priorities and syntax errors,
but not float numbers. <br />
> See [man bc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bc)

## ðŸ“¦ Compilation
```bash
make
```

## ðŸ“‹ Examples
```bash
./calc -h
# Will display:
# USAGE
# ./calc base operators size_read
# DESCRIPTION
#    - base: all the symbols of the base
#    - operators: the symbols for the parentheses and the 5 operators
#    - size_read: number of characters to be read
```

```bash
echo "3+6" | ./calc 0123456789 "()+-*/%" 3
# Will display 9
```

```bash
echo "3v6" | ./calc 0123456789 "{}vwxyz" 3
# Will display 9
```
